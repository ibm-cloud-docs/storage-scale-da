Review the following sections for the specific responsibilities for you and for {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} when you use the {{site.data.keyword.scale_full}} deployable architecture.

## Incident and operations management
{: #incident-and-ops}

Incident and operations management includes tasks such as monitoring, event management, high availability, problem determination, recovery, and full state backup and recovery.

|  | {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} Responsibilities | Your Responsibilities |
|----------|-----------------------|--------|
|Storage Scale nodes| * Deploy highly available dedicated storage nodes in a secured, IBM-owned infrastructure account for each cluster.  \n * Ensure the health of storage nodes in OS level. | Use the provided console tools to request that storage nodes are rebooted or reloaded, and troubleshoot issues such as when the storage nodes are in an unhealthy state. |
|Compute nodes | * Provision compute nodes in VPC under your IBM Cloud infrastructure account.  \n * Ensure that compute nodes successfully provision when the user account and permissions are correctly set up, and a sufficient quota exists.  \n * Fulfill requests for more infrastructure, such as adding, reloading, updating, and removing compute nodes.  \n * Fulfill automation requests to help recover compute nodes.  \n * Ensure the health of compute nodes in OS level. | * Use the provided API, CLI, or console tools to adjust storage capacity to meet the needs of your workload.  \n * Deploy application/tools in cluster |
|Cluster networking| * Set up cluster management components, such as public or private cloud service endpoints.  \n * Provide the ability to isolate network traffic with bastion nodes. | Use IBM Cloud VPC tools to adjust networking configuration to meet the needs of your workload. |
|Observability| Provide a standard IBM Cloud Console for monitoring the status of VPC resources(VSI, network, storage, and so on). | Set up and monitor the health of your cluster health metrics. |
{: caption="Responsibilities for incident and operations" caption-side="bottom"}

## Change management
{: #change-management}

Change management includes tasks such as deployment, configuration, upgrades, patching, configuration changes, and deletion.

You and IBM share responsibilities for keeping your clusters at the supported platform and operating system versions, along with recovering infrastructure resources that might require changes. You are responsible for change management of your application data.

|  | {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} Responsibilities | Your Responsibilities |
|----------|-----------------------|--------|
|Storage Scale nodes| Provide scale node patch operating system(OS), version, and security updates for image used for new cluster creation. | Use the IBM Cloud tools to apply the provided(existing) storage nodes updates that include operating system; or to request that storage nodes are rebooted. |
|Compute nodes| Provide compute node patch operating system (OS), version, and security updates. Not supported on existing running VSIs, only for new VSIs with latest image. | Use IBM Cloud tools to apply the provided compute node updates that include operating system patches; or to raise ticket to request that worker nodes are rebooted. |
|Cluster version| Provide image for new version of Scale for new cluster creation. | Update existing storage nodes and compute nodes to new Scale version, or create new cluster with latest image to run with new cluster version |
{: caption="Responsibilities for change management" caption-side="bottom"}

## Identity and access management
{: #iam-responsibilities}

Identity and access management includes tasks such as authentication, authorization, access control policies, and approving, granting, and revoking access.

You and IBM share responsibilities for controlling access to your {{site.data.keyword.scale_full}} instances. For IBM Cloud® Identity and Access Management responsibilities, consult that product's documentation. You are responsible for identity and access management to your application data.

|  | {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} Responsibilities | Your Responsibilities |
|----------|-----------------------|--------|
|Observability| Provide the ability to integrate IBM Cloud Activity Tracker with your cluster to audit the actions that users take in the cluster. | Set up IBM Cloud Activity Tracker or other capabilities to track user activity in the cluster. |
{: caption="Responsibilities for identity and access management" caption-side="bottom"}

## Security and regulation compliance
{: #security-compliance}

Security and regulation compliance includes tasks such as security controls implementation and compliance certification.

IBM is responsible for the security and compliance of Scale clusters on IBM Cloud. Compliance with industry standards varies depending on the infrastructure provider that you use for the cluster. You are responsible for the security and compliance of any workloads that run in the cluster and your application data.

|  | {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} Responsibilities | Your Responsibilities |
|----------|-----------------------|--------|
|General| Provide security controls commensurate to best practice for {{site.data.keyword.scale_full}} in Cloud.|
Provide options for cluster network connectivity, such as public and private cloud service endpoints | Set up and maintain security and regulation compliance for your apps and data. For example, choose how to set up your cluster network, protect sensitive information such as with IBM Key Protect encryption, and configure further security settings to meet your workload's security and compliance needs. If applicable, configure your firewall. |
|Storage Scale nodes| Disable certain insecure actions for storage nodes, such as not permitting users to SSH into the host. | As part of your incident and operations management responsibilities for the storage nodes, apply the provided security patch updates. |
|Compute nodes| Disable certain insecure actions for compute nodes, such as not permitting users to SSH into the host. | As part of your incident and operations management responsibilities for the worker nodes, apply the provided security patch updates. |

## Disaster recovery
{: #disaster-recovery}

Disaster recovery includes tasks such as providing dependencies on disaster recovery sites, provisioning disaster recovery environments, data and configuration backup, replicating data and configuration to the disaster recovery environment, and failover on disaster events.

IBM is responsible for the recovery of Storage Scale Computing on IBM Cloud components if there is disaster. You are responsible for the recovery of the workloads that run the cluster and your application data. If you integrate with other IBM Cloud services such as file, block, object, cloud database, logging, or audit event services, consult those services' disaster recovery information.

|  | {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} Responsibilities | Your Responsibilities |
|----------|-----------------------|--------|
|General|  | * Set up and maintain disaster recovery capabilities for your apps and data. For example, to prepare your cluster for HA/DR scenarios, follow the guidance in High availability on IBM Cloud. Note that persistent storage of data such as application logs and cluster metrics are not set up by default.  \n * Creating resources in a secondary region and managing the application and data disaster recovery. |

{: #applications-data}

You are responsible for the applications, workloads, and data that you deploy to {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}. However, {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} provides various tools to help you set up, manage, secure, integrate, and optimize your applications.

| Resource | How {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} helps | What you can do |
