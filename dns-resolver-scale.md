# DNS zones and DNS custom resolvers
{: #dns-custom-resolvers}

[{{site.data.keyword.cloud}} DNS Services](/docs/dns-svcs?topic=dns-svcs-getting-started) provides private DNS to VPC users. Also, if you have an {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} DNS Services instance ID, you can specify that ID when you create the DNS zones or custom resolvers for your {{site.data.keyword.scale_full_notm}} cluster.

## DNS zones for your {{site.data.keyword.scale_full_notm}} cluster
{: #dns}

Private DNS zones are resolvable only on {{site.data.keyword.cloud}}, and only from explicitly permitted networks in an account.

### Creating new {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} DNS setup
{: #dns-clean}

To create a {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} DNS Service instance setup and to automatically create and manage a new DNS instance ID, set the `dns_instance_id` value as "null" during deployment. In this case, the deployment creates a VPC (as necessary), DNS service instance ID, and the respective DNS zones. This process includes associating the new VPC under the appropriate permitted network.

There are five domains that are created by default:
* compute  = "comp.com"
* storage  = "strg.com"
* protocol = "ces.com"
* client   = "clnt.com"
* gklm     = "gklm.com"

### Creating DNS zones with an existing {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} DNS Services instance ID
{: #dns-existing}

If you have an existing VPC with {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} DNS Service instance ID, provide the `dns_instance_id` value during deployment. In this case, since you already have a DNS service instance ID to use, the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} cluster deployment skips creating a new DNS service instance, and creates new DNS zones from the `dns_domain_names` value for the existing DNS service instance. This process automatically associates the new DNS zones to your existing VPC under the permitted network.

Furthermore, if you have an existing {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} DNS Service instance setup, but you want the deployment to create a new VPC for your cluster, provide the DNS instance ID under `dns_instance_id` and set the `vpc_name` value as "null” (default) during the deployment. This deployment creates a new VPC using your existing DNS service instance and creates new DNS zones. This process automatically associates the new VPC under the permitted network.
For more information, see [Retrieving your instance ID](/docs/dns-svcs?topic=dns-svcs-retrieve-instance-ID&interface=ui).

A VPC cannot be a permitted network for domains of the same name. When you use an existing DNS instance ID, make sure that the DNS domains are not duplicated to avoid association issues; otherwise, you can encounter a message similar to: `Error creating PDNS permitted network: The VPC was already associated to the same DNS zone name.`

## DNS custom resolvers for your Storage Scale cluster
{: #custom-resolvers}

A private DNS custom resolver extends {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} DNS Service's capability to meet the needs of a hybrid cloud environment. It enables resolution of the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} VPC hostnames from on-premises DNS resolvers. It also enables the resolution of on-premises hostnames from {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}.

A custom resolver can always be associated with a VPC for domain name resolution. Instead of using the dedicated IBM DNS servers for resolution, you can have a managed resolution through the VPC.

### Creating custom resolvers without an existing VPC
{: #custom-resolvers-clean}

If you want a new custom resolver to be created and associated with the newly created VPC for name resolution, then leave the `dns_custom_resolver_id` value as null during the deployment. The deployment process automatically creates a new VPC and a creates and enables a new custom resolver for your cluster.

### Creating custom resolvers with an existing VPC
{: #custom-resolvers-existing}

If you already have an existing VPC and the VPC already has a custom resolver that is associated with it, then you can provide that resolver ID for the `dns_custom_resolver_id` value during the deployment. In this case, the deployment automatically uses the existing VPC for all infrastructure creation, and skips creating a new custom resolver.

A single VPC can be associated with only one custom resolver. You can have multiple custom resolvers, but you can associate each one to only a single VPC, you encounter a message similar to: `Error reading the custom resolver. The VPC already has a custom resolver`. You can [view your existing DNS resolver IDs](/docs/dns-svcs?topic=dns-svcs-details-cr&interface=ui) in {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} DNS Services.
