# IBM Cloud Monitoring
{: #cloud-monitoring-overview}

IBM Cloud® Monitoring is a cloud-native and container-intelligence management system that is included as part of your IBM Cloud architecture. The cloud monitoring is used to gain operational visibility into the performance and health of your applications, services, and platforms. It offers administrators, DevOps teams, and developers full-stack telemetry with advanced features to monitor and troubleshoot, define alerts, and design custom dashboards.

| Value | Description | Type | Default value | Validation |
| ----- | ----------- | --------------- | ------------ | ------------ |
| `observability_monitoring_enable` | Set this value as "false" to disable the {{site.data.keyword.monitoringlong_notm}} integration. If enabled, infrastructure and LSF application metrics only from management nodes are captured. | bool | true |
| `observability_monitoring_on_compute_nodes_enable` | Set this value as "false" to disable {{site.data.keyword.monitoringlong_notm}} integration. If enabled, infrastructure metrics from both static and dynamic compute nodes are captured. | bool | false |
| `observability_monitoring_plan` | This is a type of service plan for {{site.data.keyword.monitoringlong_notm}} instance. You can choose one of the following: lite or graduated-tier. For more information, refer to the [IBM Cloud Monitoring Service Plans](/docs/monitoring?topic=monitoring-service_plans). | string | "graduated-tier" | * Condition: Validates if the value matches lite or graduated-tier.  \n * Error Message: "Please enter a valid plan for {{site.data.keyword.monitoringlong_notm}}, for all details visit https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/monitoring?topic=monitoring-service_plans." |
| `observability_enable_metrics_routing` | Enable the metrics routing to manage metrics at the account level by configuring targets and routes that define how the data points are routed. | bool | false |
{: caption="{{site.data.keyword.monitoringlong_notm}} variables" caption-side="bottom"}

You can use {{site.data.keyword.metrics_router_full_notm}}, a platform service to manage metrics at the account-level by configuring targets and routes that define where data points are routed.

To check whether Cloud Monitoring is configured correctly on your VSI, SSH into the instance and run the following commands:

```pre
systemctl status prometheus
```

```pre
systemctl status dragent
```

Go to the `cloud_monitoring_url` in the terraform output.
For example: https://cloud.ibm.com/observe/embedded-view/monitoring/e68481cb-21ff-45bb-90db-cee02cebed3d

Following are the steps to manually access the dashboard:

1. Go to Observability > Monitoring > Instances.
2. Search the name of the metrics instance.
3. On the right-side, click Dashboards.
4. The dashboard results in a visual confirmation of logs that are captured and flow.
